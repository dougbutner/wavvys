A ride on the wild side with a figment of your imagination. This music video is a masterpiece of the power of the mind, as our main character falls manically in love with an impossibly perfect large bearcat, of whom she is the sole beholder. The punk-esque song has noise and melody, and the lyrics can be taken to mean many things depending whose meaning gets applied. Overall, this a really well done piece, and miles above any other music video released this month.
