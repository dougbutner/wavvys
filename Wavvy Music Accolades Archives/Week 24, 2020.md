This one-shot music video puts immersive theater on the small screen. The whole thing is quite mesmerizing, and shows what a small group of creative people can do in just a few minutes, with many hours of planning, of course. The human emotion in the performance accents the song, which centers around a fear of losing the love of another. But it all seems to end well for Trent.

## [What a World by Husband](https://music.cxc.world/?id=1454&zoom=10&locLat=51.209&locLng=0.417)
📍 London, UK
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️](https://music.cxc.world/?id=1454&zoom=10&locLat=51.209&locLng=0.417)*

What a World tackles deep emotions that come from living in a turbulent world. This is one of those songs that hits different for each person listening. It's a complex time that we are all moving through right now, and music is one of the best ways to understand the feeling of the moment, and heal.

'What a World' tackles the feeling of disconnect towards tragic world events as they are so far removed from our everyday lives. It embodies the feeling of guilt towards this disconnect and the resulting nonchalance towards such events, despite being so much bigger than the daily issues you face." -

## [Bryan's Magic Tears performing Ghetto Blaster & Slamino Days](https://music.cxc.world/?id=1705&zoom=10&locLat=48.533&locLng=2.749)
📍 Paris, France

Bryan's Magic Tears packs a sound that brings us back to the best of the 90s with symphonies played on electrified strings. At one point in the second song I felt a purely-sonic spiritual element that is rarely found in this genre. The harmony of guitars, vocals and analogue effects is something to behold.

This song is like a long walk through a national park. It keeps pace, talking you from landscape to landscape, with some beautiful sights along the way, and also some leery cliffs. The album is over two and a half hours long, so put it on and be ready for a long hike.
